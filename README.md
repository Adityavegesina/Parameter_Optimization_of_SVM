# Support Vector Machine

Support Vector Machine or SVM is one of the most popular Supervised Learning algorithms, which is used for Classification as well as Regression problems. However, primarily, it is used for Classification problems in Machine Learning.

The goal of the SVM algorithm is to create the best line or decision boundary that can segregate n-dimensional space into classes so that we can easily put the new data point in the correct category in the future. This best decision boundary is called a hyperplane.

SVM chooses the extreme points/vectors that help in creating the hyperplane. These extreme cases are called as support vectors, and hence algorithm is termed as Support Vector Machine.

# Dataset
This dataset was derived from geospatial data from two sources:
- Landsat time-series satellite imagery from the years 2014-2015.
- Crowdsourced georeferenced polygons with land cover labels obtained from OpenStreetMap.
- [Link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Crowdsourced+Mapping)
- The dataset was split in a 70:30 ratio and 10 different samples were taken
